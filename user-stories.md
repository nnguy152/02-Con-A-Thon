# CON-A-THON
### Nerdy Conventions Galore!

Get your geek on by planning out your year's con schedule! 

This site allows users to see a list of all the anime (bonus: comic and gaming conventions) in the USA. Users can view the date and location of each convention. Each convention will have a link to the con home page so users can easily check-out more specific details.
