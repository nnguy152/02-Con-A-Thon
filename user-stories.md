## PokeStop 
Nerdy Culture
This site allows users to see and contribute links and images of nerd culture in an Instagram-like fashion. Users will be able to save images/links they like in their profile. Images will popup with detail of that image and links (if it's referencing someplace or something) and links will direct users to those sites.
